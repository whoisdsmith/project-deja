# Life Is Just A Box

---

I waited for you by a park bench cause I was too nervous to stand.

Said you meet me there in a little while and we talk about our plans.

Our plans to succeed and the things that we need to get ourselves out of this place.

Found myself in bed with a whole lot of nothing and bills to pay.

We laid in the snow until our fingers froze.

The beer cans held hands in conversation.

This was a moment not worth forgetting.

And you looked inside me like some car driving into some foreign Hollywood sunset.

And my eyes fit the part of some cheap storyboard where you wake up and everything's okay.

But our closets smell so old.

I'll be the shirt you wish you could hold.

I'll be gone long gone.

Just a memory in a stomach.

Just a part of your stomach filled with regret of your time not worth it.

I always enjoyed quality television.

The kind you watch when you already know what's gonna happen.

The part where the hero dies and more problems derived.

Cause the air in his lungs will no longer breathe life.

And the world's most renowned people gather round to watch this tragedy on display.

And a mother just smiles while she holds the TV down to keep her children from knowing she's hurting.

They might not know she's not invincible.

But our closets smell so old.

I'll be the shirt you wish you could hold.

And when you open the door, I'll be dressed in my finest attire.

I'll be gone long gone.

I'll be gone long gone.

Just a memory in a stomach.

Just a part of your stomach filled with regret of your time not well spent.

I'll be gone long gone.

I'll be gone.

I'll be gone.

I'll be gone.

Doctor, can you please help me?

I've run out of options and I think I need just a little bit of whatever it is that you would prefer.

Yeah, I'll fill all the forms and do the things that you say.

As long as these pills make this pain go away.

As long as I can somehow find my place in this melancholy day.

Is all the others, all the others, all the others.

Isn't there some place that's quiet where I can lay down for a second?

Did anybody want to be banned on from my happiness?

It's useless in these paintings to frame someone with talent.

With my best in the phobics, I vote answer.

I'll turn anything else a matter.

I've got my problems, you've got answers.

I don't forget that this is cancer.

I don't forget that this is cancer. był był był był był bill
