# Keep It Steady

---

Hello my friends, I guess that this is the end 
I hope that you listened well 
and maybe you fell 
In love with these words 
so honest and pure 

That you could kept it steady, 
yeah you could kept it steady 
Then you said to me, of so sincerely 

I think of you so differently 
If you could be and I could be 
so much more than they'd ever dream 

Yeah we'll could keep it steady 
And we'll could keep it steady 

now She wore her smooth pearl earrings, shiny and white 
I want myself, my soul, my heart, my love And we made it right, right 

So let's try on each other's shoes 
To see how it feels being someone else 
And let's forget all of our plans 
And have our distance go unanswered 
And let's wear our souls tight enough 
To never let anything come between us 
Cause you're what makes me believe 
You're what makes me believe That it's fairytale 

Hello my friends, I guess that this is the end 
This is my second verse But I hope it's not worse 
Than the one you heard before You opened the door 
and you could kept it steady And you could kept it steady 

So let's just forget all the stupid words said 
We make mistakes, I've made mistakes 
And she'll try as long as it takes 
To make sure that I'm far gone 
But we'll could keep it steady 
And we'll could keep it steady now 

So let's try on each other's shoes 
To see how it feels being someone else 
And let's forget all of our plans 
And have our distance go unanswered 
And let's wear our souls tight enough 
To never let anything come between us 
Cause you're what makes me believe 
You're what makes me believe 
These stupid fairytales 
These stupid fairytales 
Might be true
