# When Open Air Becomes a Battlefield

---

Now that it's down to this, am I gonna dangle on this deadline?
Waiting for time to cut the only strings I'm holding on to 
So when I fall, I know it'll be nothing graceful, tasteful 
Even by the lowest standard, beautiful 
Just as dull as the sound you make me 

So when I speak, I hope it'll be 
something to add up Or equal, 
maybe greater than Anything you say 

You're thriving, a false hope 
Pretending that every single piece of hope 
Will go into bloom and make you feel back into place 
It's not that easy It's not that easy It's not that easy 

Never even met the thought that could ever run through my mind Described by reason, that I should wake up tomorrow And find you there Oh, well, you see, just like my last dream Our sound was becoming things that you would love to see And love to breathe, and love to feel I will clasp my hands and choke the prayer that will evoke The heart inside me to start beating I will clasp my hands and choke the prayer that will evoke The heart of mine to start beating I will clasp my hands and choke the prayer that will evoke The heart of mine to start beating I will choke the prayer that will evoke my heart to start beating again You're thriving, a false hope Pretending that every single piece of hope Will go into bloom and make you feel back into place It's not that easy It's not that easy It's not that easy You're thriving, a false hope Pretending that every single Piece of hope Will go into bloom and make you feel back into place
