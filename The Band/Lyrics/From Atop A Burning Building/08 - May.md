Well I swear by blue in your eyes I never lied to you So I wrote you the secret I hope you can keep it as close as promises You're so many ways Let's keep this ghost romance away Things could have been left in this coffin Buried alive Fingertips they leave scars like traces On constantly reminding I've opened the door I'll show you just how I grew Let fear pass right through Pass it right through And footsteps replace words with actions We wish we should have taken Let's keep this ghost romance away Things could have been left in this coffin Buried alive Fingertips they leave scars like traces On constantly reminding I told you I would keep this warm I told you I would keep this warm Boy were you such the fool Let's keep this ghost romance away Things could have been left in this coffin Buried alive Fingertips they leave scars like traces On constantly reminding I am alone I am alone I am alone I am alone you
