# Valuntas Tua

Watch You Fall Away.

You Were Dying To Escape.

Like A Cloth To A Table Made For Four.

Your Weary Dress Couldn't Bear Anymore.

You Were Tired, So Quiet, So Nice.

The Christians Forgot To Tell.

They Left You At Five.

Quiet In Your Coffee Shop, Your Tiny Little Restaurant.

And Jesus, I Think I Need You Now, Cause I Can Feel This World Wrap Itself Around Me Like A Rope.

It Says Jump, Dear Friend, Just See If Your Beliefs Will Save You.

And The Pictures Fell Down As We Sat Around And Spoke Out.

Hit The Top Of Our Lungs, Where You Said You'd Marry Me.

I Said That It's Not Easy, That's Just Why I'd Go And Throw It All Away.

Where You Said I Think I Love You More Than The Dreams We All Would Die Starving For.

If You Would Just Look To The Right, You'd See That I'm Passing By.

Wait For Me.

Wait For Me.

Wait For This To End.

Wait For.

And The Pictures Fell Down As We Sat Around And Spoke Out.

Hit The Top Of Our Lungs, Where You Said You'd Marry Me.

I Said That It's Not Easy, That's Just Why I'd Go And Throw It All Away.

Hit The Top Of Our Lungs.

Hit The Top Of Our Lungs
