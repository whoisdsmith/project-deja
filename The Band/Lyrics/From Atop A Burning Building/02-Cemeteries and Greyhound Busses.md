# Cemeteries and Greyhound Busses

---

And there's a spot in the cemetery where a car sat parked and you were buried, yes you were buried, you were buried in my arms.

Said he touched you, he touched you in all the wrong places and you were never felt so alone.

We were full bloom white despite worse in July, our hearts in our hands, ambitions towards the sky.

Our hearts were not pockets, they were sealed with a promise and I broke mine on the 8th of July.

So keep playing your piano, make sure that you're hitting for the game.

You'll get what you want, keep playing on your record.

Especially the lines around your eyes, so sweet, so to cover up the scars.

I told you I'd hustle like moonlight to kill myself and have an end in my life, hurt no one else.

I touched your white pearl necklace like Marilyn Monroe and all you could do was just shake.

You kept it a secret for as long as you could keep it but you let it seep beneath your teeth and it's getting hard for me to breathe.

Your eyes were the only thing you had to say.

So keep playing your piano, make sure that you're hitting for the game.

You'll get what you want, keep playing on your record.

Especially the lines around your eyes, so sweet, so to cover up the scars.

Is this the world we all dreamed of or God just sits up above?

I'm down here on my knees asking someone come and help me please.

Is this the life we waited for?

Why I feel so insecure?

We're down, yeah we're down.

Buried like coffins deep within your chest, the stories you'd love to confess.

Cemeteries and Greyhound buses, how could I forget?

Is this the world we all dreamed of or God just sits up above?

I'm down here on my knees asking someone come and help me please.

Is this the life we waited for?

Why I feel so insecure?

I'm down, yeah I'm down.

Buried like coffins deep within your chest, the stories you'd love to confess.

And how could I forget?

How could I forget?

And how could I forget?

How could I forget you?

So keep playing your piano.

Make sure that you're hitting all the keys.

You'll get what you want.

Keep playing on your knees.

Especially the lines around your eyes.

So sleep tight. you â€¦
