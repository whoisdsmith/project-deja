# Goodbye Mr. Perfection (MM Version)

---

I opened up my eyes today The ceiling was dressed in white Opened up to a brand new day You said, we'll take this down and make it beautiful If only my eyelids could save me from A world full of choices I'm too scared to make And we should never lay our hands Without pondering our thoughts Or hearing those words you say Sweetie, I don't mind Just forget everything I don't mind Lay down your thoughts And the cigarette just blew away When all I know I tried You said, take this down and make it beautiful Make this worth the price Sitting here, those strains collide I've got my fingers crossed for us both I wish I had a camera to freeze this moment I've got my fingers crossed for us both I wish I had a camera I've got my fingers crossed for us both I've got my fingers crossed for us both I've got my fingers crossed for us both I've got my fingers crossed for us both I've got my fingers crossed for us both I've got my fingers crossed for us both I've got my fingers crossed for us both
