# View of Coma (MM Version)

---

I'm gonna sing it to you.

So you got my walls of embarrassment Surround my ears with contentment So that they syllables into my bloodstream Become the very vessels that take this sickness from me So you carried my belongings And like baggage threw them to the ground After a long time walking there was no love inside of me to be found And how my feet would wander Like the leaves that fell from trees I ask God why do I suffer Cause now it's like the time to invest this love inside of me And her eyes burn into silence Like police from pews Out of sight and out of view Will you bury this?

Will you smother this?

So that my past becomes a souvenir to add To the clutch and the things that I have once since overcome I felt as empty as a bubble JFK once you realized you wasn't alive But getting stabbed was not a chance That poor gun Those poor hands they were never meant to kill But somehow life got in the way And her eyes burn into silence Like police from pews Out of sight and out of view She cries and cries and cries and cries and cries Will you bury this?

Will you smother this?

So that my past becomes a souvenir to add To the clutch and the things that I have once since overcome I felt heaven in my heart Like a burning star, like a burning star I felt heaven in my heart Now she opens her eyes Directs them towards the sky Says is there any room for him and I In your kingdom?

Now she opens her eyes Directs them towards the sky Says is there any room for him and I In your kingdom?

And her eyes burn into silence Like police from pews Out of sight and out of view Will you bury this?

Will you smother this?

So that my past becomes a souvenir to add To the clutch and the things that I have once since overcome I felt heaven in my heart Like a burning star, like a burning star I felt heaven in my heart Now she opens her eyes Directs them towards the sky Says is there any room for him and I In your kingdom?

Now she opens her eyes Directs them towards the sky Says is there any room for him and I In your kingdom?
