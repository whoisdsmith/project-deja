# Winona Ride-You

---

Saw you in that movie, acting all loopy  
Falling for that old man, who had scissors for his hands  
Then I knew, then I knew you were the girl interrupted  
Making my heart a volcano erupting

Doesn't matter that you stole all those things  
You stole my heart and I'm not gonna live without it

everyday Everyday, everyday, everyday,  
everyday Everyday, everyday,

all night All night,  
all night I wanna Winona ride you  
All night, all night I wanna Winona ride you

Paid seven fifty to see you act  
All I wanna do is hit it from the back  
Paid seven fifty to see you act  
All I wanna do is hit it from the back
