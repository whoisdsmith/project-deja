# Where Are The Angels Now

---

But I'm out with nothing left to show.

But I owe you some dirty air that escapes.

Only when I'm spread wide open, like a centerfold review.

Like my shoes they tap merrily down the stream.

Past the bars and coffee shops that house those who are empty.

Where are the angels now?

I said where are the angels now?

Well she wrote to hide her guilt of pain.

As we sighed but sweetly I wonder, does it ever go away?

Said you like to feel the rain, so if you want to save a dress, it's the one you wear when you feel it's empty.

As the can't you kick from underneath your feet and the grass still bends.

That spot where you and I lay, we made love, still I'm in love.

But whatever it was, it was the closest to perfect that I've ever been.

What have I become?

But a man with nothing to show.

Watch as it falls apart, a result of what I've done.

Where are the angels now?

I said where are the angels now?

Well she wrote to hide her guilt of pain.

As we sighed but sweetly I wonder, does it ever go away?

My friends ask me why do I believe there's a spirit up above who actually cares for us after all they'll see the things we've done.

Why else if they believe in the wicked things they don't often see like the truth it holds within human hands.

They care, they care, they care at all.

So I puke out black widows with taint on wings and just because they have wings doesn't mean they're butterflies.

And I feel I'm ripping everything apart.

And if I were to crash my car into this tree tonight, would you cry or would you worry?

Would you even care at all?

In the slightest little bit.

Chw quiet returned vodka.
