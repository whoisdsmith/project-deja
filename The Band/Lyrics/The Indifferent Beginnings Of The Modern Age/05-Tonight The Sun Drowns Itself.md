# 05-Tonight The Sun Drowns Itself

---

Used to believe that I was perfect  
But I've seen hospitals enough to know  
We all make mistakes

Mistakes like The needles  
digging into your veins  
Engulfing you with A dirty feeling of regret

As your hand reaches for the floor  
To press against The freezing cold and lonely young  
You ponder Memories like rain  
Industrial like the winds of change

But tonight the sun drowns itself  
We lie awake and watch tidal waves smash the ocean Sigh  
the sky reports We rip it apart  
Death seems angry at God  
Cause we don't have everything we need

Safe in your arms tonight  
Trapped inside this paradigm  
Where this book is endless in grace  
And as the ultraviolet rays  
Bleed light through shades into  
Your new morning room

We swim throughout this fabric  
Stitched tight enough to keep this  
Commitment tucked inside  
Our hands dirt stained And pressed against our ears

To drown out The sound of letting go

But tonight the sun drowns itself  
We lie awake and watch tidal waves smash the ocean Sigh  
the sky reports We rip it apart  
Death seems angry at God  
Cause we don't have everything we need

Safe in your arms tonight  
Trapped inside this paradigm  
Where this book is endless in grace  
We have the best sandcastles  
We're great at tearing them down

Fold me like a napkin  
Place me on display  
How much will I sell for?

Coffee stains and dull  
Seems like that's all we're here for  
To get the purity soaked straight  
From our bones

Now our ships will sail in accord  
with the mist Dixie  
The soul in this distance  
Is a mixture I cannot breathe

We lift up our breasts to a charcoal sky  
Swimming with our hands  
Stretching upward begging for more time

Tonight the sun drowns itself  
We lie awake and watch tidal waves smash the ocean Sigh  
the sky reports We rip it apart  
Death seems angry at God  
Cause we don't have everything we need
