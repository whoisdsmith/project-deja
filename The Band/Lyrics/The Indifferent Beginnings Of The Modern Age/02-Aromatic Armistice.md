# 02-Aromatic Armistice

---

You can almost hear them now, those children whisper, trying to get out of here.

They hung beneath the trees, between the branches and the ground.

Branches become support beams that will never let them down.

Cut the rope, cut the rope, make sure to catch them when they fall.

And they will, like the sun burns out of the skies.

Slap them tightly in blankets, keep them safe from the cold, make sure that they get home.

They were caught from trees so loud, we'd watch as the wind of Kaiser tears all the locks into acres, just that theme.

Marta, Marta, she screamed, as reflections of an ambulance, with the sleepy eyes of innocence.

Marta, Marta, she screamed, as reflections of an ambulance, with the sleepy eyes of innocence.

The guns were silenced like cemeteries in small towns, you should have seen.

The glass that shredded his neck apart, in the center of this traffic.

As lights illuminate high story buildings, the smoke will rise.

We will fall, like papers in his hands so firm.

On the way, gently, slowly.

The guns were silenced like cemeteries in small towns as we died away.
