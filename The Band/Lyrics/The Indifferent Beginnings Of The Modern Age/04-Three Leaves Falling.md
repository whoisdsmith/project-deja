# 04-Three Leaves Falling

---

This I've filled glass of champagne These wavelengths across my heart While three dry leaves fall away I looked away in disbelief They all get antsy as they carry their cameras to the funeral home Addressed in fake smiles they drag along for miles As they pretend they're not And you ask me a question Just what can I do for you?

And if you were to come down Well ask yourself would it be better?

We open our eyes to colored gloves Dressed in black and white Pretending to celebrate their fallen friends' lives Suffocating is so much easier When you're not used to breathing Suffocating is so much easier When you're not used to breathing And the chariots of fire Wait for me to leave this I turn this black dress out of the way And the sign that says go bye bye So we wait for another small chance at life to take place Saw you lift a day and smiled Your coat kept you warm and I stayed content to Drift through all your thoughts where I could always have you Everything is old and varnished Torn leather, broken bathtubs It's open and gloomy as a 16 year old boy Watching Romeo swallow a pill in the silhouette Of a young girl with a revolver aimed straight at her head Pave your way Through a thousand tidal waves Pave your way Through a thousand tidal waves Cameras fade and wish they never saw Tragedy is blessed too A blanket white trail of bounds This blade through a wild tiny neighborhood Sorry for attention The hallways aren't as clear as the eyes I once knew Look back And we remember Too small If we lay the carpet just right The trigger should stop the fight Leaving in the dead of night Mindless all those pretty birds Singing underneath the meadow You got to wish your wife was ready Suffocating is so much easier when You're not used to breathing Suffocating is so much easier when You're not used to breathing Can the chariots of fire Wait for me to leave this A town that's plagued with empathy Can the sign that says go but So we wait for another small chance At life to take place
