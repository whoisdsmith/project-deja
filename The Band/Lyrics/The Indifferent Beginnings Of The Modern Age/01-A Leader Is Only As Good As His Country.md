# 01-A Leader Is Only As Good As His Country

---

Stretch the spoons with scissors, so they might understand, failure As she rides through the wind, re-elect a leader We'll send your kids home in a coffin, draped in American flags The lion, we call ourselves heroes, and we strap another bot to a pig's chest The lion will tell you about pride, he has a tear, sees the floor, and laughs at you again Our knees and empty earth, as the seventh trumpet blows and sends waves of silence through the earth Well, she's become an escape route, appealing to all in search of death But it will never come And we call ourselves heroes, as we strap another bot to a pig's chest The lion will tell you about pride, he's a libel and gets to win while the surf wave takes my grave We'll send you home in a coffin, draped in American flags The thickness of a fence and the depth of a grave will determine our remembrance after death And my heart hangs half-mast for every thirty-year-old man stuck inside the same circle as everyone else And we ask ourselves, is this worth it?

If you're gonna choke, make sure it tastes right Make sure the colors of the flowers match the color of the casket that's open and waiting The lion And we call ourselves heroes, as we strap another bot to a pig's chest The lion will tell you about pride He has the tears and the floor, and laughs at you again The lion And we call ourselves heroes, as we strap another bot to a pig's chest The lion will tell you about pride He has the tears and the floor, and laughs at you again As the song fades into a distant memory, we'll remember all the things that kept us alive Spinning images swell our cords with feeling and remind us that the silence is full of sound On a private drive, we're easily broken homes and easily shattered lives, just regular as the fireflies that won't scream for air We lay backs, tucked against the cement, watch the world pass by And it's in times like these that God appears farther away than the distant specks of gas thrown across the black curtain that we refer to in the midnight sky Out of reach and out of time, we watch the world pass by We watch the world pass by We watch the world pass by Leaders, only as good as this country Leaders, only as good as this country Leaders, only as good as this country
