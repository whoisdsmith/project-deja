# Goodbye Mr Perfection

---

I Opened Up My Eyes Today  
The Ceiling Was Dressed In White  
I Opened Up To A Brand New Day  
She Said, We'll Take This Town And Make It Beautiful  
If Only My Little Save Me From  
A World Full Of Choices I'm Too Scared To Make

And We Should Never Lay Our Hands  
Without Pondering Our Thoughts  
Or Hearing Those Words You Say  
Sweetie, I Don't Mind  
Just To Forget Everything  
I Don't Mind Lay Down Your Thoughts, She Said

And Our Cigarette Just Blew Away  
On Our Late Night Drives  
She Said, Take This Town And Make It Beautiful  
Oh, Make This Worth The Fight  
Sitting In Those Trains, Crying  
Sitting In Those Planes, Fly By

Got My Fingers Crossed For Us Both  
I Wish I Had A Camera To Phrase This Moment  
I've Got My Fingers Crossed For Us Both  
I Wish I Had A Camera  
I've Got My Fingers Crossed  
My Fingers Crossed For Us Both  
Got My Fingers Crossed  
My Fingers Crossed

And We'll Take A Break And Sit With Our Loved Ones At The Lodge  
Got My Fingers Crossed  
My Fingers Crossed  
My Fingers Crossed For Us Both  
Got My Fingers Crossed  
My Fingers Crossed  
My Fingers Crossed For Us Both  
For Us Both  
For Us Both
