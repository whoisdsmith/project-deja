Let's Use Overtramatics And Antipragmatics And Maybe The Equation Will Show All Of The Liaisons Of Friends Who Never Tell You The Truth, They'd Rather Sell You For Such A Small Profit.

When These Summer Days Are Drawing To A Close, No One's Ever Prepared For This, Tell Me Why Do They Say It's Too Late, Why Do They Show?

We're Suffocating, But Very Often, We Run Out Of Breath And We Run Out Of Virtue.

It's A Shame I Didn't Save You From The Fire That Begave You, But The Blazing Words Of Me To See How You Can Burn So Easily, Doubt Me Double-crossed If I Must, I've Got My Losses And Take What I Can't Get, When These Summer Days Are Drawing To A Close, No One's Ever Prepared For This, Tell Me Why Do They Say It's Too Late, Why Do They Show?
