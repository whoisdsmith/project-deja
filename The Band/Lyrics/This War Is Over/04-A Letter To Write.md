# A Letter To Write

---

It's Okay, I Know You're Breathing  
I've Seen The Sheets Rise, I've Saw The Ceiling  
But I'm Not Here, I'm Not Dancing  
To Make An Incision I've Already Made  
A Decision To Hold Back The Blade

I Never Wanna View  
The Beauty Inside You

I've Let This Match Burn Too Long,  
Now I'm Feeling Pain All Too Familiar  
A Sensation To Know, I've Let This Go  
I'm Finally Free As The Smoke

Carries You Away  
Carries You Away

If You Crave The Attention Given  
It's Not My Fault You Spent Your Winnings  
On A Dress That'll Hold You Together  
My Words Have To Cut You Out

I Render You Speechless When I Call You Disgrace  
Just Hold It Close For A Warm Embrace  
The Closest, The Closest I'll Ever Come Or Again

I've Let This Match Burn Too Long Now  
I'm Feeling The Pain All Too Familiar  
A Sensation To Know I've Let This Go I  
'M Finally Free As The Smoke

Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away

I've Let This Match Burn Too Long  
Now I'm Feeling The Pain All Too Familiar  
A Sensation To Know I've Let This Go  
I'm Finally Free As The Smoke

Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away  
Carries You Away
