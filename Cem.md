In this spot, in this cemetery, you were a cross I thought And you were buried, yes you were buried, you were buried And my arms said he touched you, he touched you And all the wrong places and you, it never felt so wrong We were full bloom white, despite worries in July Our hearts and our hands, ambitions towards the sky Our hearts were not pockets, they were sealed With a promise and I broke mine on the 8th of August So keep playing your piano And make sure that you're hitting all the notes Every single day You'll get where you are Keep putting on your makeup And just leave the lines around your eyes For sweet, true, to cover up the scars I told you I must like being light to kill myself And have an end in my life, hurt no one else Touch a white pearl necklace like Marilyn Monroe's And all you can do is just shake You kept it a secret for as long as you could keep it But you'd let it seep beneath your teeth And it's getting hard for me to breathe And your eyes were the only thing you had to say So keep playing your piano And make sure that you're hitting all the notes Every single day You'll get where you are Keep putting on your makeup And just leave the lines around your eyes For sweet, true, to cover up the scars Is this the world we all dreamed of?

Where God just sits up above I'm down here on my knees asking Someone come and help me please Is this the life we've waited for?

Will we feel so insecure?

We're down, yeah we're down Buried like coffins deep within your chest The stories you'd love to confess Cemeteries and Greyhound buses How could I forget?

Is this the world we all dreamed of?

Where God just sits up above I'm down here on my knees asking Someone come and help me please Is this the life we've waited for?

Will I feel so insecure?

I'm down, yeah I'm down Buried deep like coffins in your chest The stories you'd love to confess And how could I forget?

How could I forget?

And how could I forget?

How could I forget you?

So keep playing your piano Make sure that you're hitting all the keys You'll get what you want Keep playing on your guitar These guys sleep in lines around your house Sleep tight
