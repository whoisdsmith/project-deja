As of my knowledge cutoff date in September 2021 and based on the information available, deja norm'al was a band that was characterized by its unique and creative elements. The band's style was described as a combination of "sheer liquid" and "awesome," and it was believed by some that the band was conceived from this essence of "sheer liquid awesome." The band members were praised for their musicianship and their passion for the music they created.

The band was based in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, and had associations with the Lake City, Michigan area. The members of deja norm'al included individuals named Jerrod Herig, Bailey, Karl, and possibly some others. Unfortunately, the band is no longer active and has disbanded, according to the available information.

Despite searching for specific details about the band's activities between the years 2004 and 2008, I was unable to find any information that outlines their specific endeavors, releases, or performances during that time period. It's possible that the band had local performances, released music, or participated in events during those years, but there is no available information that provides details on their activities during that timeframe.

As a result, it is challenging to provide a more detailed account of deja norm'al's activities and achievements between 2004 and 2008, as there is no publicly available information that outlines these details.
