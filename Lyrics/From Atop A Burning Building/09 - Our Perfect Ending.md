# Our Perfect Ending

---

Well I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you This is my way of saying goodbye And maybe someday our paths will collide And there'll be fireworks painting the sky It'll be our perfect ending To our perfect life Surrounded by all our perfect memories Accompanied by all the perfect delights I know I'm not the best at keeping promises You should've known this from the start But I guess it's all a plan And we'll never understand Why is it that we try so hard And this is our perfect ending To our perfect life And these are our perfect memories Accompanied by all the perfect delights Cause I've got a lot of things I'd like to say But I'm not okay And I'll do my best to make believe my sins Are justified Well I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you Well I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you Where have you been all my life?

But in the background, in the back of my mind Just another person I don't need to find And this is our perfect ending To our perfect life And these are all our perfect memories Accompanied by all the perfect delights
