# From Atop A Burning Building

---

Swing low into the ground, my friend.

Your delicate time has come to an end.

We'll take your house and burn it to the ground.

Watch the smoke rise up into the closet.

Sometimes I wish I could rip my heart out of my chest.

Spilling dirty blood on God's feet as I beg.

Oh, I beg for Him to make me cure.

Let me serve you somehow.

But I guess that I am not perfect.

When you cry yourself to sleep, I'll do my best to make believe that I am the blanket you strangle yourself in.

And even Satan smiled as he watched the smoke fill my lungs.

I just laughed as I felt my cancer sting my ribcage to sleep.

Oh, to sleep.

And now on everything I swore that I would ever be.

Of everything I swore.

That I would never be.

I swore.

I swore.

I swore.

Save me the taste of spit it out.

Save me the taste of spit it with me.

Then she's gonna wake down and I'll take it again with me.

Save me the taste of spit it out.

Save me the taste of spit it with me.

Don't you ever question me again.

Know how I laugh is you fell asleep.

I let you down your cross and your crown.

With my umbrella above my head to block out your whispers.

Thank you.
