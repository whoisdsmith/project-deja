Take Down The Walls Of Embarrassment Surround My Ears With Contentment So That These Syllables Into My Bloodstream Become The Very Vessels That Take This Sickness From Me So You Carry My Belongings My Baggage To Them To The Ground After A Long Time Walking There Was No Love Inside Of Me To Be Found And How My Fear Would Wander Like The Leaves That Fell I'm Trying To Choose I Ask God Why Do I Suffer Cause No One Takes The Time To Invest This Love Inside Of Me And Her Eyes Burn Into Silence Like Weeds From You Inside And Out Of View Will You Bury This?

Will You Smother This?

So That My Past Becomes A Souvenir To Add I Cheated Things That I Had Long Since Only Feel Through I Felt His Empty Ass JFK Once He Realized He Wasn't Alive And Didn't Have A Chance That Poor God Those Poor Hands They Were Never Meant To Kill But Somehow Life Got In The Way In Her Eyes Burn Into Silence Like Weeds From You Outside And Out Of View She Cries And Cries And Cries She Cries Will You Bury This?

Will You Smother This?

So That My Past Becomes A Souvenir To Add I Cheated Things That I Had Long Since Only Feel Through I Felt Heaven In My Heart Like A Burning Star, Like A Burning Star I Felt Heaven In My Heart I Felt Heaven In My Heart Like A Burning Star, Like A Burning Star I Felt Heaven In My Heart And I Felt Heaven In My Heart Like A Burning Star, Like A Burning Star I Felt Heaven In My Heart And Her Eyes Burn Into Silence Like Weeds From You Outside And Out Of View Will You Bury This?

Will You Smother This?

So That My Past Becomes A Souvenir To Add I Cheated Things That I Had Long Since Overcome Thanks For Watching!
